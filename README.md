# Towards Dual-view X-ray Baggage Inspection: A Large-scale Benchmark and Adaptive Hierarchical Cross Refinement for Prohibited Item Discovery

The entire DvXray dataset is updated! Note that we also update the bounding-box labels so that our DvXray can support research on more reliable computer-aided screening systems and can serve the evaluation of various detection tasks.
